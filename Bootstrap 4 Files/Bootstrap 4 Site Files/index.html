		<h2>Face the Cataclysm</h2>
		<p>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a turn-based survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or, if you are lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities, from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have…</p>
		<p>The core tenet of dark days ahead is if it works in reality, it works in the game. Scavenge and craft makeshift weapons, improvise shelter, outmaneuver enemies, find, repair and drive vehicles. Deal with monsters using your brains, melee weapons, firearms, traps, explosives, other monsters, fire, and if all else fails, a truck or two.</p>
		<p>DDA uses a hybrid turn-based system. Each action has a move cost, many of which are procedurally determined. Once actions deplete an actor’s move points, their turn ends and any other game entities act for a similar duration. Game actors receive an allotment of move points each turn based on their stats and conditions. All game entities, including the player character, monsters and NPCs use the same system.</p>

			<h2>Game Philosophy </h2>
			<p>
				Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a turn-based survival RPG that utilizes a top-down, grid-based view. The graphics are either character-based or use layered tiles.
				
				DDA presents an uncompromising survival scenario to overcome, but also presents a huge variety of options for problem solving, both of which are deeply rooted in a reality-based view of the post-apocalyptic scenario. This grounding results in sometimes unexpected inversions of gaming tropes, where storage capacity of clothing is more important than armor, or weight of highly effective gear outweighs its effectiveness.</p>
			<p>Cataclysms reward system is built around roleplay, survival and exploration.

				The key concept of the game is, “what would you do in the Cataclysm?”, and the game allows you to answer that question in a bewildering number of ways.
				
				The goal of game difficulty is to start out with survival being difficult, and get steadily more difficult over time, requiring mastery of a succession of game systems in order to continue to survive and thrive.</p>
			<p>
				DDA fully embraces the sandbox concept of gaming. There are goals in DDA, and stories and missions, but the only universal goal is survival.
				
				Short-term objectives include obtaining gear and supplies, learning things, crafting items, helping fellow survivors and exploring.
				
				Medium-term objectives include securing supply sources, establishing a base camp or base vehicle, recruiting NPC allies, joining a faction and clearing an area of enemies.
				
				Long-term objectives include deeply customizing your base camp and/or vehicle, securing a large surplus of supplies, founding a faction and/or making a faction self-sufficient and defeating large groups of enemies.</p>
